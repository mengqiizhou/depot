This project is written in Ruby in Rails. The project supports functionality for two types of users: the seller and the buyer. On seller's page, the seller is able to create, edit, and update items that he wants to sell. After adding picture, creating description, and setting  price, the seller is able to put items on display for customers to purchase. On the buyer's page, the buyer is able to add itenms he wants to his shopping cart. The cart will automatically calculate the total price of the items in it. The button of "empty cart" allows the buyer to remove all the items in the cart.
